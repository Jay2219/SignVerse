Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
- To run Machine Learning Model on application, the app uses the [flutter_tflite](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tflite) package which supports Android and iOS.
